<h2>Problem: Department Duel</h2>
<p>The Principal of VIIT wants to determine which department is better at programming: <strong>CSE</strong> or <strong>ACSE</strong>. The heads of both departments claim their students are the best. To resolve the debate, the Principal decides to conduct a coding contest.</p>
<p>The contest consists of 5 questions, each carrying 100 marks. The winner is determined by calculating the average percentage of scores for each department. The department with the higher average is declared the winner. If the number of scores provided is less than the total number of students in a department, assume the scores of the non-participants to be <strong>0</strong>.</p>
